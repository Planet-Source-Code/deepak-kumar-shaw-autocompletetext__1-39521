### Description

This is a very simple demonstration of the beginner VB programmer to show how they can improve there projects and give a professional touch to implement the ideas of auto-text. As IE address bar.

This Sample also shows how to work with windows API's.

I hope Beginners could enjoy this demo project and could get some really nice idea for improvements.
